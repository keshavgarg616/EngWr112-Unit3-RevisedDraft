                Saregama Carvaan, a Bluetooth speaker with an in-built library of Bollywood songs from its golden era, ranging from the 1950s to the late 1980s. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It has been given the look of an old radio from the 1940s to evoke nostalgic memories of listening to music. Although the Carvaan has modern features like a display, Bluetooth functionality, USB support, and an FM radio, it has been deliberately marketed as a product for the older generation – as a portal that you can just turn on to take you on a journey through your past. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As Jeremy J. Sierra and Shaun McQuitty suggest, “People may purchase items (e.g., memorabilia) in an attempt to preserve their past (Motley, Henderson, and Baker 2003) and to facilitate self-continuity by connecting with a desirable past” <a href="sources.html">(Sierra et al. 99)</a>. 
            </p>
                This psychological effect of nostalgic purchases has clearly been kept in mind while designing the Saregama Carvaan.
