                As Cesare Amatulli, Giovanni Pino, Matteo De Angelis, and Robert Cascio stated, ‚ÄúVintage products are generally considered objects of ‚Äòadoration‚Äô for cultural reasons and, in many cases, for their superior quality. ‚Ä¶. This is particularly true for luxury vintage products of brands, such as Bulgari, Cartier, Chanel, Herm√®s, and Rolex, that have been sold at prices that well exceed twice that of their original retail price‚Äù <a href="sources.html">(Amatulli et al. 616)</a>. We can see how product trends resemble a parabolic figure in their popularity. The rage about these new products peaks at their release and dies down as they become old news, but what is interesting is the phenomenon that happens after a few years or decades. At this point, after a period of unpopularity, the products are considered vintage and sometimes become even more popular than when they were first launched.

                The correlation between developing a good brand image and using the past as a marketing tactic is so powerful that consumers will tend to buy products without even batting an eye. Something that might‚Äôve been considered an everyday item to adults as they grow up, such as Lucky Charms or Legos, might bring them back to melancholic memories of middle school breakfasts and their schooldays as they pass by the aisles in the grocery store.
